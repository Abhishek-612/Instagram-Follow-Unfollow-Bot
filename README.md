# Instagram-Follow-Unfollow-Bot
A bot to automate Instagram from web. The script uses the **Webdriver** from the `Selenium` package. The script allows one to automatically _login_ to his/her account, and also to _follow/unfollow_ an account.

Before running the script, you need to install chromedriver for the specific operating system, from [chromedriver.chromium.org](chromedriver.chromium.org) and extract the folder in `bot.py`
